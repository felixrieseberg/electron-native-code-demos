# Electron & Native Code Demos

This repository demonstrates how you can integrate native code and even native UI elements into your Electron application. It's meant as both a tutorial and as a starting point for you own development. All packages implement a simple `helloWorld()` function that modifies a string as well as a `helloGui()` function that launches a basic todo editor with all-native controls.
